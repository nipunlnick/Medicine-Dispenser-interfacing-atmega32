Medicine Dispenser with Alarm, Buzzer, and Text Message with interfacing atmega32

## Project Description:

This GitHub repository hosts the code for the "Medicine Dispenser with Alarm, Buzzer, and GSM SIM900A" project. The project is driven by the increasing challenges faced by older individuals in managing their medications effectively, especially when dealing with multiple prescriptions and strict schedules. The Medicine Dispenser with Alarm, Buzzer, and GSM SIM900A offers an innovative solution to address this issue and ensure on-time medicine intake.

## Key Features:

Interfacing with Atmega32 microcontroller.
Automated medicine dispensing using a stepper motor.
Alarm system for medication reminders.
GSM SIM900A module for sending SMS reminders to patients.
Project Details:

This repository provides a comprehensive overview of the project, covering both hardware and software components, circuit design, and system functionality. It includes the code for interfacing with the Atmega32 microcontroller and controlling the stepper motor, alarm system, and GSM module. The system is designed to trigger the dispenser at the scheduled medication times, ensuring precise medication delivery. Simultaneously, it sends SMS reminders to patients' mobile phones to keep them informed about their medication schedule.

By combining these technologies, the Medicine Dispenser project simplifies medication management and significantly improves patient compliance. The SMS reminders are an effective means of ensuring patients stay on track with their treatment plans. This project represents a significant step forward in leveraging technology to enhance healthcare outcomes and patient well-being.
